# 🏠 Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview
The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a full-stack web application inspired by Airbnb, designed to replicate the core functionalities of the global accommodation booking platform.  
The project aims to help developers understand the architectural, design, and engineering principles behind large-scale web systems. It emphasizes collaboration, scalability, and clean software design.

### 🎯 Project Goals
- Build a feature-rich booking platform with user authentication, property management, and payment integration.  
- Explore full-stack development using modern frameworks and best practices.  
- Strengthen understanding of system design, database modeling, and API security.  
- Practice collaborative development using GitHub and CI/CD pipelines.

## 🗃️ Database Design

### Key Entities

#### **Users**
- `id` (Primary Key)  
- `name`  
- `email`  
- `password`  
- `role` (e.g., guest, host)

#### **Properties**
- `id` (Primary Key)  
- `host_id` (Foreign Key → Users)  
- `title`  
- `description`  
- `price_per_night`  
- `location`

#### **Bookings**
- `id` (Primary Key)  
- `user_id` (Foreign Key → Users)  
- `property_id` (Foreign Key → Properties)  
- `check_in_date`  
- `check_out_date`  
- `status`

#### **Reviews**
- `id` (Primary Key)  
- `user_id` (Foreign Key → Users)  
- `property_id` (Foreign Key → Properties)  
- `rating`  
- `comment`

#### **Payments**
- `id` (Primary Key)  
- `booking_id` (Foreign Key → Bookings)  
- `amount`  
- `payment_method`  
- `payment_status`

### Relationships
- A **User** can own multiple **Properties**.  
- A **Property** can have multiple **Bookings**.  
- A **Booking** belongs to one **User** and one **Property**.  
- A **Review** is linked to both a **User** and a **Property**.  
- A **Payment** is tied to a **Booking**.

## 🔐 API Security

### Key Security Measures

- **Authentication:**  
  Implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth2 to verify user identities and protect endpoints.

- **Authorization:**  
  Role-based access control ensures users can only perform actions within their permission scope.

- **Rate Limiting:**  
  Prevents abuse and denial-of-service attacks by restricting the number of requests per user.

- **Input Validation:**  
  Protects against SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF attacks.

### Importance of Security
- Protects sensitive **user data** such as passwords and payment info.  
- Ensures **transaction integrity** during bookings and payments.  
- Builds **trust** by safeguarding user activity and personal information.

## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
**Continuous Integration (CI)** is the process of automatically testing and merging code changes into a shared repository.  
**Continuous Deployment (CD)** automates the release of these changes to production environments.

### Why It Matters
- Reduces human error and ensures faster deployments.  
- Maintains high code quality through automated testing.  
- Enables rapid iteration while minimizing downtime.

### Tools Used
- **GitHub Actions** for automating build, test, and deployment workflows.  
- **Docker** for containerized environments.  
- **Heroku / AWS / Render** for cloud-based deployment.
